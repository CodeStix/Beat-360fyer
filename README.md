# Beat-360fyer

This tool is used to generate 360 levels from standard Beat Saber levels.

## :computer: How to use it?
1. Download the software from the [releases page](https://github.com/CodeStix/Beat-360fyer/releases) & unzip.
2. Execute `Beat-360fyer.exe`.
3. Select your CustomLevels directory or select a single level.
4. Choose the levels which you want to generate a 360 gamemode for. By default, this is all of them.
5. Select the difficulty you wish to convert. Or choose to convert all difficulties, this will take longer if you have a lot of levels.
6. Wait for the process to finish.
7. Start up Beat Saber, the 360 mode should appear in the original levels! Have fun!

## :question: How well does this work?
:heavy_check_mark: **It works great with** not too spammy levels with a lot of cut direction variation. This is a great tool to spice up the easy levels!

:warning: **It works not as good with** spammy levels, this works, but it will a have hard time of knowning when to rotate the level, so don't expect sick 360 no-scopes when converting, for example, GHOST. I am not saying you shouldn't try it tho!

## :mag: Demo
Here are some demo levels, generated with this tool:
