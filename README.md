4. Select your Beat Saber directory.

6. Press the generate button, it will copy all the chosen songs and then generates new gamemodes.
7. Wait for the process to finish.

### Generate and modify (for map makers) 
> :warning: **Not recommended for normal use, will break ScoreSaber on standard levels!**

## :question: How well does this work?
:heavy_check_mark: **It works great with** not too spammy levels with a lot of cut direction variation. This is a great tool to spice up the easy levels!

:warning: **It works not as good with** spammy levels, this works, but it will a have hard time of knowning when to safely rotate the level, so don't expect sick 360 no-scopes when converting, for example, GHOST. I am not saying you shouldn't try it tho!
