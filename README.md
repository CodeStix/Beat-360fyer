# Beat-360fyer

This tool is used to generate 360 levels from standard Beat Saber levels.

## :computer: How to use it?
### Generate a Music Pack (recommended) (requires *SongCore*)
1. Make sure you have the [SongCore (by Kylemc1413)](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/SongCore) mod installed, this is required to create custom music packs.
2. Download the tool from the [releases page](https://github.com/CodeStix/Beat-360fyer/releases) & unzip.
3. Execute `Beat-360fyer.exe`.
4. Select `Generate Music Pack`.
5. Select your Beat Saber directory.
6. Choose the levels which you want a 360 mode for.
7. Press the generate button, it will copy all the chosen songs and then generates new gamemodes.
8. Wait for the process to finish.
9. Start up Beat Saber, a music pack should appear named 'Generated 360 levels'.
### Generate and modify (for map makers) 
> :warning: **Not recommended for normal use, will break ScoreSaber on standard levels!**
1. Download the tool from the [releases page](https://github.com/CodeStix/Beat-360fyer/releases) & unzip.
2. Execute `Beat-360fyer.exe`.
3. Select `Generate And Overwrite`.
4. Select your Beat Saber directory.
5. Choose the levels which you want a 360 mode for.
6. Press the generate button, it will modify the `Info.dat` of the chosen levels, and then generate new gamemodes.
7. Wait for the process to finish.
8. The selected maps now have a 360 mode.

## :question: How well does this work?
:heavy_check_mark: **It works great with** not too spammy levels with a lot of cut direction variation. This is a great tool to spice up the easy levels!

:warning: **It works not as good with** spammy levels, this works, but it will a have hard time of knowning when to safely rotate the level, so don't expect sick 360 no-scopes when converting, for example, GHOST. I am not saying you shouldn't try it tho!
